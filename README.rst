checkerboard
============
checkerboard is a learning/experimentation project.  The goal is to implement a
socket library that uses C++ language features to ensure compile-time safety
(e.g., trying to bind an INET socket with an INET6 address shouldn't compile).
It's not expected to reach production quality.
